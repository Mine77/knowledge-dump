## Contract Example
This is a contract example for a ticket selling. There are basically state variables and functions with a contract and all of them would be deployed in the block chain and the contract itself is also an account.  
Because crypto currency will be transferred through contract, it is always important to double check security of the contract. There are several patterns help to secure the contract.   
### Re-entrancy Problem and condition-effect-interaction pattern
### Gas limit problem and Withdrawl Pattern

pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract EventRegistrant {

	//basic class of registrant
	struct Registrant {
		uint amount;
		uint numTickets;
		string email;
	}

	//define variables
	address public owner;
	uint public numTicketsSold;
	uint public quota;
	uint public price;
	mapping (address => Registrant) registrantsPaid;
	
	event Deposit (address _from, uint _amount);
	event Refund (address _to, uint _amount);

	//Modifiers to define following functions
	//character "_" means this is a modifier
	modifier onlyOwner(){
		require(msg.sender == owner);
		_;
	}
	
	modifier soldOut(){
		require(numTicketsSold < quota);
		_;
	}

	function EventRegistrant(uint _quota, uint _price) public {
		owner = msg.sender;
		numTicketsSold = 0;
		quota = _quota;
		price = _price;
	}

	function buyTicket(string email, uint numTickets) soldOut public payable {
		uint totalAmount = price * numTickets;
		require(msg.value > totalAmount);
		if (registrantsPaid[msg.sender].amount > 0) {
			registrantsPaid[msg.sender].amount += msg.value;
			registrantsPaid[msg.sender].numTickets += numTickets;
			registrantsPaid[msg.sender].email = email;
		} else {
			registrantsPaid[msg.sender].amount = totalAmount;
			registrantsPaid[msg.sender].numTickets = numTickets;
			registrantsPaid[msg.sender].email = email;
		}
		
		numTicketsSold += numTickets;
		
		if (msg.value > totalAmount) {
			uint refundAmount = msg.value - totalAmount;
			require(msg.sender.send(refundAmount));

		Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
	}
	
	//this is an example of condition - effect - interaction 
	//the purpose is to prevent re-entrancy
	function refundTickets(address buyer) onlyOwner public {
		//Phase 1: check condition to see if the transaction legal

		registrantsPaid[buyer].amount = 0;
		registrantsPaid[buyer].numTickets = 0;
		numTicketsSold -= numTicketsToRefund;

		//Phase 3: make the interaction to refund the buyer
		require(buyer.send(amountToRefund));
		Refund(buyer, amountToRefund);
	}
	
	function withdrawFunds() onlyOwner public {

	}

	function getRegistrantsAmountPaid(address buyer) public view returns (uint) {
