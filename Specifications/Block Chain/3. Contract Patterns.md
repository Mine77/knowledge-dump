## Contract Example
This is a contract example for a ticket selling. There are basically state variables and functions with a contract and all of them would be deployed in the block chain and the contract itself is also an account.  
Because crypto currency will be transferred through contract, it is always important to double check security of the contract. There are several patterns help to secure the contract.   
### Re-entrancy Problem and condition-effect-interaction pattern
Check method `refund` in example contract. This to prevent a user to get multiple fnuds before varaibles modified. 
### Gas limit problem and Withdrawl Pattern
Check method `refundAll` in exmaple contract.

	/*
	reason I have 2 mappings:
	There is not "length" for a mapping, because a mapping is not suppose to be fixed.
	As a result, iteration of a mapping is not recommended. In this scenario, usually one mapping to record index 
	and the other mapping for details.
	
	"registrantsIndex" is to record index of paid addr. 
	1. check if an addr paid
	Because default value in solidity is zero, address did not pay if the index == 0 (the leastest 1) 
	2. get all paid addr
	With varaible "numRegistrants", this mapping provides a list of paid addrs. 
	
	"registrantsDetail" is to save details for addrs. 
	In this mapping, details for a registrant can be fetched by index.
